Or how a smartphone can identify your voice and separate it from background noise? The answer lies in a powerful mathematical tool called the <strong>Fourier Transform</strong>.</p> <h2 id="what-is-a-fourier-transform">What Is a Fourier Transform?</h2> <p>At its core, the Fourier Transform is a way of taking something that changes over time—like a sound wave—and breaking it down into its basic building blocks: <strong>sine and cosine waves</strong>. These are the purest, simplest types of waves, and amazingly, you can combine them in the right way to recreate any complex wave.</p> <p>Think of it like a musical chord. A chord is made up of different notes played together. The Fourier Transform helps you figure out what those individual notes (frequencies) are in a complex sound.</p> <h2 id="time-domain-vs-frequency-domain">Time Domain vs Frequency Domain</h2> <p>When you record sound, you usually see it as a waveform over time. This is called the <strong>time domain</strong>. But if you apply a Fourier Transform, you shift to the <strong>frequency domain</strong>, where you can see how much of each frequency is present in the sound.</p> <p>This is what lets us “see” sounds!</p> <h3 id="time-domain">Time Domain</h3> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Sound wave = Amplitude vs Time
</code></pre></div></div> <h3 id="frequency-domain">Frequency Domain</h3> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Spectrum = Amplitude vs Frequency
</code></pre></div></div> <h2 id="why-is-this-useful">Why Is This Useful?</h2> <p>Fourier Transforms have <strong>real-world applications</strong> in:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Audio Compression</strong> (MP3, AAC): Identifies parts of the sound we can’t hear and removes them.</li> <li><strong>Brainwave Analysis</strong> (EEG): Helps analyze patterns in brain signals.</li> <li><strong>Voice Recognition</strong>: Helps identify unique frequency patterns in a person’s voice.</li> <li><strong>Image Processing</strong>: JPEG uses a similar concept called the Discrete Cosine Transform.</li> <li><strong>Wireless Communication</strong>: Helps break down signals into different channels.</li> </ul> <h2 id="a-simple-visual-example">A Simple Visual Example</h2> <p>Imagine clapping your hands. The sound isn’t a pure tone—it’s a mixture of many frequencies. If we record that sound and apply a Fourier Transform, we’ll get a <strong>spectrum</strong> showing which frequencies are involved.</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Clap sound (Time domain) → Fourier Transform → Frequency Spectrum
</code></pre></div></div> <p>This is what audio visualizers in music players actually show!</p> <h2 id="fast-fourier-transform-fft">Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)</h2> <p>The math behind Fourier Transforms can be intensive, but there’s an efficient version called the <strong>Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)</strong> that computers use. It’s the reason real-time sound visualization is possible.</p> <h2 id="what-are-sine-and-cosine-waves">What Are Sine and Cosine Waves?</h2> <p>A <strong>sine wave</strong> is a smooth, periodic oscillation. If you were to watch a point move around a circle at constant speed and plot its vertical position over time, you’d get a sine wave. It has a perfectly repetitive and continuous form, oscillating between a maximum and minimum value.</p> <p>The <strong>cosine wave</strong> is just the same wave, shifted in phase by 90 degrees (or (\frac{\pi}{2}) radians). While sine starts at zero, cosine starts at its maximum.</p> <p>Mathematically:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>sin(x) — starts at 0 and rises
cos(x) — starts at 1 and drops
</code></pre></div></div> <p>They both repeat every (2\pi) units and are described as <strong>periodic</strong> functions. These functions are the foundation of trigonometry and appear in countless areas of physics and engineering.</p> <h2 id="frequency-amplitude-and-phase">Frequency, Amplitude, and Phase</h2> <p>To fully describe a sine or cosine wave, we need to know:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Frequency</strong> – how fast it oscillates (measured in Hz)</li> <li><strong>Amplitude</strong> – how tall the wave is (its energy or volume)</li> <li><strong>Phase</strong> – where the wave starts in its cycle (measured in degrees or radians)</li> </ul> <p>Different combinations of these parameters create the rich variety of tones we hear in music and nature.</p> <h2 id="why-are-they-important-for-sound">Why Are They Important for Sound?</h2> <p>Every pure tone you hear (like a tuning fork or a flute note) is basically a sine wave of a specific frequency. These are the fundamental frequencies. But most real-world sounds—like speech, music, or noise—are <em>combinations</em> of many sine waves of different frequencies and amplitudes.</p> <p>These waves interact, amplify, cancel, and shape each other, forming the full richness of sound. Understanding how to separate and analyze these building blocks is what makes sound engineering and digital signal processing possible.</p> <h2 id="superposition-of-waves">Superposition of Waves</h2> <p>One of the most powerful properties of sine and cosine waves is <strong>superposition</strong>. This means that two or more waves can be added together to form a new, more complex wave.</p> <h3 id="example">Example:</h3> <p>If you add:</p> <ul> <li> \[\( \sin(x) \) — a low-frequency wave\] </li> <li>( 0.5 \cdot \sin(3x) ) — a higher-frequency wave</li> </ul> <p>you get a wave that still looks smooth, but it’s no longer just a simple tone—it’s a richer sound with multiple frequencies.</p> <p>The ear and brain perceive this combination as a single sound, but math allows us to pull it apart.</p> <h2 id="visualizing-this-with-manim">Visualizing This with Manim</h2> <p>In the accompanying Manim animation, you’ll see:</p> <ol> <li>A complex wave (sum of sine waves)</li> <li>The individual components: one low-frequency sine wave and one higher-frequency sine wave</li> <li>How these add up visually and mathematically to recreate the original wave</li> </ol> <p>This process mirrors what the <strong>Fourier Transform</strong> does—it dissects a signal into a collection of sine and cosine waves.</p> <h2 id="why-this-matters">Why This Matters</h2> <p>Understanding sine and cosine waves is like learning the letters of a language before writing poetry. Before we can decompose sound with Fourier analysis, we need to understand what it’s made of.</p> <p>These waveforms are everywhere—in sound, in light, in vibrations, in radio waves, and even in the quantum world. Mastering their behavior is key to unlocking many of the secrets of nature and technology.</p> <p>In the next post, we’ll explore how to transition from viewing a signal in time to analyzing it in <strong>frequency</strong>, giving us an entirely new way to understand sound.</p> <p>This theme supports rendering beautiful math in inline and display modes using <a href="https://www.mathjax.org/">MathJax 3</a> engine. You just need to surround your math expression with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$$</code>, like \(E = mc^2\).

The Babylonians, who lived in this region around 3000 BCE, developed a sophisticated numerical system, algebraic techniques, and applications in astronomy and commerce that influenced later civilizations. The mathematical knowledge of the Babylonians was recorded on clay tablets, many of which have been preserved, providing valuable insight into their computational methods and practical applications.</p> <h2 id="the-sexagesimal-base-60-number-system">The Sexagesimal (Base-60) Number System</h2> <p>One of the most remarkable contributions of Mesopotamian mathematics was their <strong>sexagesimal (base-60) number system</strong>. Unlike the base-10 decimal system we use today, the Babylonians used a positional system based on powers of 60. This system allowed them to perform complex calculations, including multiplication, division, and fractions.</p> <h3 id="key-features-of-the-babylonian-number-system">Key Features of the Babylonian Number System:</h3> <ul> <li><strong>Positional Notation</strong> – Similar to our decimal system, the value of a digit depended on its position.</li> <li><strong>Lack of Zero</strong> – Early versions of the system did not include a zero, which led to ambiguities in numerical representation. However, later Babylonian texts introduced a placeholder symbol for zero in positional notation.</li> <li><strong>Ease of Fractions</strong> – Base-60 allowed for easier division of numbers into common fractions, making it ideal for trade and astronomy.</li> <li><strong>Tables and Computation</strong> – Babylonian scribes recorded multiplication tables, reciprocal tables, and square root approximations on clay tablets, facilitating efficient calculations.</li> </ul> <p>The influence of this system can still be seen today in how we measure time (60 minutes in an hour) and angles (360 degrees in a circle).</p> <h2 id="babylonian-algebra-and-problem-solving">Babylonian Algebra and Problem-Solving</h2> <p>Babylonian mathematicians developed algebraic techniques centuries before Greek mathematics formalized algebraic thought. They solved problems using methods equivalent to modern quadratic equations and systems of linear equations. Unlike later Greek mathematicians, who used geometric approaches to solve equations, the Babylonians relied on arithmetical techniques and tabulated values.</p> <h3 id="examples-of-babylonian-algebra">Examples of Babylonian Algebra:</h3> <ul> <li><strong>Quadratic Equations</strong> – Clay tablets show step-by-step solutions to equations of the form ( ax^2 + bx = c ), using methods that resemble modern algebraic techniques.</li> <li><strong>Linear Systems</strong> – Problems involving simultaneous equations, often related to trade and property distribution. Babylonian texts provide examples of solving for multiple unknowns using substitution and elimination methods.</li> <li><strong>Geometric Calculations</strong> – Finding areas of rectangles, triangles, and trapezoids, along with approximations for square roots. The Babylonians approximated the square root of 2 with remarkable accuracy (~1.4142), as seen in the <strong>Plimpton 322</strong> tablet.</li> </ul> <p>These early algebraic methods were recorded on clay tablets, some of which still exist today, providing a glimpse into the problem-solving techniques of ancient mathematicians.</p> <h2 id="applications-in-astronomy-and-calendar-systems">Applications in Astronomy and Calendar Systems</h2> <p>The Babylonians were among the first to use mathematics for astronomical observations. Their understanding of cycles in the sky allowed them to create accurate calendars and predict celestial events. Babylonian astronomy was deeply connected to their religious and agricultural practices, as precise knowledge of celestial movements was crucial for determining festival dates and planting seasons.</p> <h3 id="contributions-to-astronomy">Contributions to Astronomy:</h3> <ul> <li><strong>Lunar Calendars</strong> – The Babylonians divided the year into 12 months, each based on the lunar cycle, with periodic adjustments to synchronize with the solar year.</li> <li><strong>Planetary Movements</strong> – Observations of Venus and other planets helped in developing early models of celestial motion. They tracked planetary positions over long periods, forming predictive models.</li> <li><strong>Eclipses</strong> – Babylonian astronomers could predict lunar and solar eclipses using mathematical calculations and cyclical patterns of celestial bodies.</li> <li><strong>Ziggurats as Observatories</strong> – Some of the large Mesopotamian temple structures, known as <strong>ziggurats</strong>, may have been used as astronomical observatories to track the positions of celestial bodies.</li> </ul> <p>Their detailed astronomical records greatly influenced later Greek and Islamic astronomers, shaping the development of celestial mechanics.</p> <h2 id="practical-uses-in-trade-and-administration">Practical Uses in Trade and Administration</h2> <p>Mathematics played a crucial role in Mesopotamian trade, taxation, and administration. Merchants and scribes used calculations for measuring land, accounting, and resource distribution. The importance of accurate calculations in economic activities led to the standardization of units and written contracts.</p> <h3 id="mathematical-applications-in-daily-life">Mathematical Applications in Daily Life:</h3> <ul> <li><strong>Weights and Measures</strong> – Standardized units were used in trade to ensure fairness in transactions. The Babylonians established measurement systems for weight, volume, and length that were critical for commerce.</li> <li><strong>Taxation Systems</strong> – Detailed records of taxes and economic exchanges were maintained using numerical records. Scribes recorded grain distributions and livestock counts, ensuring the efficient collection of tributes and payments.</li> <li><strong>Engineering and Construction</strong> – Babylonian engineers used mathematical principles to design irrigation systems and city planning. Advanced techniques were used in the construction of canals and large-scale infrastructure projects.</li> <li><strong>Loan Agreements and Interest Rates</strong> – Babylonian mathematics was also applied in financial transactions, including loan agreements with interest calculations. Some of the earliest known banking records, including calculations of compound interest, date back to this period.</li> </ul> <hr/> <p>Mathematics in Ancient Mesopotamia laid the foundation for many concepts still in use today. Their base-60 system, algebraic methods, and applications in astronomy and trade demonstrate the sophistication of their mathematical knowledge.

Long before the development of formal mathematical theories, early humans engaged in numerical thinking to survive, trade, and build their communities. This post explores the origins of mathematical thought in prehistoric times, highlighting early counting systems, number representations, and the practical applications of mathematics in daily life. While prehistoric humans had no formal mathematical notation, their methods of quantifying, measuring, and predicting events laid the groundwork for later civilizations.</p> <h2 id="the-origins-of-counting">The Origins of Counting</h2> <p>The ability to count is one of the most fundamental aspects of mathematics. Prehistoric humans relied on simple methods to keep track of numbers, such as:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Tally Marks</strong> – Carved lines on bones, wood, or stones to represent quantities.</li> <li><strong>Finger Counting</strong> – Using fingers as natural counting tools.</li> <li><strong>Pebbles and Knots</strong> – Small objects or tied knots to store numerical information.</li> <li><strong>Body Parts as Reference</strong> – Some cultures used body proportions to estimate lengths and sizes.</li> </ul> <p>One of the earliest examples of tally marks is the <strong>Ishango Bone</strong>, a 20,000-year-old artifact found in Africa, which suggests that early humans had an understanding of arithmetic sequences and possibly even prime numbers. Additionally, researchers believe the markings on bones may have served as lunar calendars, helping early societies track time.</p> <h2 id="early-number-systems">Early Number Systems</h2> <p>As societies became more complex, so did their need for numerical systems. Prehistoric humans developed basic number representations, such as:</p> <ul> <li><strong>One-to-One Correspondence</strong> – Matching one object to another to keep track of quantities.</li> <li><strong>Symbolic Notation</strong> – Using distinct symbols to represent different numbers, as seen in the <strong>Lebombo Bone</strong> from Africa.</li> <li><strong>Grouping Systems</strong> – Evidence of early base systems, like base-5 or base-10, inferred from tally marks.</li> <li><strong>Proto-Writing Systems</strong> – Some early societies developed rudimentary symbols to convey numerical values, influencing later written number systems.</li> </ul> <p>By using these early methods, prehistoric humans could track possessions, count resources, and communicate essential numerical information, leading to more sophisticated systems in later civilizations.</p> <h2 id="the-role-of-geometry-in-survival">The Role of Geometry in Survival</h2> <p>Geometry was an essential part of prehistoric life, helping early humans in activities such as:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Construction</strong> – Using geometric principles to build shelters and monuments.</li> <li><strong>Land Measurement</strong> – Dividing land for agriculture or territorial boundaries.</li> <li><strong>Art and Symbols</strong> – Cave paintings and rock carvings often exhibit geometric patterns.</li> <li><strong>Star Mapping</strong> – Many prehistoric structures were aligned with celestial bodies, showcasing early understanding of spatial reasoning.</li> </ul> <p>Megalithic structures like <strong>Stonehenge</strong> and <strong>Nabta Playa</strong> demonstrate that early civilizations used geometry and astronomical alignments to create sophisticated constructions for religious or timekeeping purposes. These alignments suggest an understanding of angles, seasonal shifts, and possibly early trigonometric principles.</p> <h2 id="practical-applications-of-mathematics-in-prehistoric-life">Practical Applications of Mathematics in Prehistoric Life</h2> <p>Mathematical thinking played a crucial role in survival, leading to:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Hunting and Gathering</strong> – Estimating distances and tracking time for seasonal migrations.</li> <li><strong>Trade and Economy</strong> – Basic accounting and measurement systems for exchange.</li> <li><strong>Timekeeping</strong> – Observing celestial movements to track seasons and lunar cycles.</li> <li><strong>Weather and Seasonal Prediction</strong> – Using natural patterns to predict favorable conditions for planting and harvesting crops.</li> </ul> <p>Early trade routes relied on estimation and basic calculations, and societies that could effectively measure and manage resources had a survival advantage over others. The ability to quantify resources also led to the development of bartering systems, where goods could be exchanged based on approximate values.</p> <hr/> <p>The prehistoric era laid the foundation for mathematical thinking. From simple tally marks to complex astronomical alignments, early humans unknowingly developed mathematical principles that would later evolve into formal mathematics. The necessity of survival encouraged innovation in counting, measurement, and spatial reasoning, shaping the way future civilizations would develop mathematical thought.</p> <p>As we move forward in this series, we will explore how these early concepts influenced ancient civilizations like Mesopotamia and Egypt, where mathematics became more structured and essential to governance, trade, and science.</p> <p>Stay tuned for the next post: <strong>Mathematics in Ancient Mesopotamia</strong>!</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Mathematics"/><category term="Mathematics"/><category term="History"/><category term="Prehistoric"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Exploring the origins of mathematics in prehistoric times, from early counting methods to the use of geometry in survival and construction.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Creating a PID Controller Using ATmega328P: Theory and Implementation</title><link href="https://sanath-thilakarathna.github.io/blog/2025/ATMEGA328p-PID-post/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Creating a PID Controller Using ATmega328P: Theory and Implementation"/><published>2025-02-18T10:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-02-18T10:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://sanath-thilakarathna.github.io/blog/2025/ATMEGA328p-PID-post</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://sanath-thilakarathna.github.io/blog/2025/ATMEGA328p-PID-post/"><![CDATA[<p>The <strong>PID controller</strong> (Proportional-Integral-Derivative controller) is a fundamental control system component used extensively in engineering and industrial applications. It is important because it provides precise, stable, and responsive control across various systems by minimizing error and optimizing performance. PID controllers are critical in applications like motor speed control, temperature regulation, robotics, and automation where consistent and accurate control is required.
