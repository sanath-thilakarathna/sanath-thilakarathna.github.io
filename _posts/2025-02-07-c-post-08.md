System calls are the interface between a user program and the operating system. In C, system calls allow programs to interact with hardware resources, manage processes, and handle files. In this post, we will explore **system calls**, **file handling**, and **inter-process communication (IPC)**.

---

## 1. Understanding System Calls

A **system call** is a request made by a program to the operating system for a service such as file I/O, process creation, or memory allocation. Common system calls include:
- `fork()` - Creates a new process.
- `exec()` - Replaces the current process image.
- `wait()` - Makes a process wait for child process termination.
- `open()`, `read()`, `write()`, `close()` - File handling operations.

### 1.1 Example: Using `fork()`
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main() {
    pid_t pid = fork();
    if (pid == 0) {
        printf("Child process\n");
    } else {
        printf("Parent process\n");
    }
    return 0;
}
```

### 1.2 Example: Using `exec()`
```c
#include <unistd.h>
int main() {
    char *args[] = {"/bin/ls", "-l", NULL};
    execvp(args[0], args);
    return 0;
}
```

## 2. File Handling in C

File handling in C is done using system calls or standard library functions like `fopen()`, `fprintf()`, `fscanf()`, etc.

### 2.1 Opening and Closing Files
```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    FILE *file = fopen("example.txt", "w");
    if (file) {
        fprintf(file, "Hello, C!");
        fclose(file);
    }
    return 0;
}
```

### 2.2 Reading and Writing Files
```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    char buffer[100];
    FILE *file = fopen("example.txt", "r");
    if (file) {
        fgets(buffer, sizeof(buffer), file);
        printf("Read from file: %s", buffer);
        fclose(file);
    }
    return 0;
}
```

## 3. Inter-Process Communication (IPC)

### 3.1 Pipes
Pipes enable data transfer between processes.
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
int main() {
    int fd[2];
    pipe(fd);
    write(fd[1], "Hello", 6);
    char buffer[10];
    read(fd[0], buffer, sizeof(buffer));
    printf("Received: %s\n", buffer);
    return 0;
}
```

### 3.2 Message Queues
Message queues allow structured message passing.
```c
#include <sys/ipc.h>
#include <sys/msg.h>
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    int msgid = msgget(IPC_PRIVATE, 0666 | IPC_CREAT);
    printf("Message Queue ID: %d\n", msgid);
    return 0;
}
```

System calls and file handling are fundamental to operating system interactions in C. Understanding **process management, file operations, and IPC mechanisms** enables efficient resource management and communication between processes.

In the next post, we will explore **writing and using libraries in C**, including static and dynamic libraries.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
