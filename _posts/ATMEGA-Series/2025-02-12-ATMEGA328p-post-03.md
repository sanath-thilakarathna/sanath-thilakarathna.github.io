## Introduction

Timers are an essential feature of microcontrollers, enabling precise timing operations without blocking the CPU. The ATmega328P includes **Timer0, Timer1, and Timer2**, each with distinct capabilities. Additionally, **Pulse Width Modulation (PWM)** allows us to generate analog-like outputs for motor control, LED dimming, and signal generation.

## Overview of ATmega328P Timers

The ATmega328P has three hardware timers:
- **Timer0:** 8-bit, commonly used for delays, timing, and PWM.
- **Timer1:** 16-bit, ideal for precise timing, servo control, and waveform generation.
- **Timer2:** 8-bit, similar to Timer0 but also supports asynchronous operation.

Timers work by counting clock cycles and triggering actions when they reach a predefined value. The behavior is configured using **prescalers**, **modes**, and **interrupts**.

### Timer Operating Modes
Timers can be operated in different modes:
1. **Normal Mode** – Simple counting, useful for time measurement.
2. **CTC Mode (Clear Timer on Compare Match)** – Automatically resets the timer upon reaching a compare value, useful for accurate time delays.
3. **Fast PWM Mode** – Used to generate PWM signals by varying the duty cycle.
4. **Phase Correct PWM Mode** – Ensures symmetric PWM signals, commonly used in motor control.

## Timer Registers
Timers are controlled using several registers:

| Register  | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **TCCRnA** | Configures timer mode and output compare mode |
| **TCCRnB** | Configures clock source and prescaler |
| **TCNTn** | Holds the current timer count value |
| **OCRnA/B** | Stores the compare match values for interrupts or PWM |
| **TIMSKn** | Controls interrupt enable bits |
| **TIFRn** | Flags indicating timer events |

## Generating Precise Delays Using Timers
Instead of using `_delay_ms()`, which blocks execution, we can use timers for efficient delays.

### Example: Configuring Timer1 for a 1s delay using CTC Mode
```c
#define F_CPU 16000000UL
#include <avr/io.h>
#include <avr/interrupt.h>

void timer1_init() {
    TCCR1B |= (1 << WGM12); // Configure Timer1 in CTC mode
    OCR1A = 15624; // Set compare value for 1s delay (16MHz/1024 prescaler)
    TCCR1B |= (1 << CS12) | (1 << CS10); // Set 1024 prescaler
    TIMSK1 |= (1 << OCIE1A); // Enable Timer1 compare interrupt
    sei(); // Enable global interrupts
}

ISR(TIMER1_COMPA_vect) {
    PORTB ^= (1 << PB5); // Toggle LED
}

int main() {
    DDRB |= (1 << PB5); // Set PB5 as output (LED)
    timer1_init(); // Initialize Timer1
    while (1) {}
}
```
### Explanation:
- Configures **Timer1** in **CTC mode**.
- Uses **OCR1A** for a **1s delay**.
- Uses **interrupts** to toggle an LED without blocking CPU execution.

## Understanding PWM (Pulse Width Modulation)
PWM simulates an analog signal using a digital output by rapidly switching between HIGH and LOW states at a set frequency. The duty cycle determines the proportion of HIGH time in one cycle.

### PWM Applications:
- **LED Dimming** – Controlling brightness smoothly.
- **Motor Control** – Adjusting speed and direction.
- **Signal Generation** – Creating analog-like waveforms.

### PWM Output Pins:
PWM is available on these ATmega328P pins:
- **Timer0:** OC0A (PB0), OC0B (PD5)
- **Timer1:** OC1A (PB1), OC1B (PB2)
- **Timer2:** OC2A (PB3), OC2B (PD3)

### Example: Generating PWM on PB1 using Timer1
```c
#define F_CPU 16000000UL
#include <avr/io.h>

void pwm_init() {
    DDRB |= (1 << PB1); // Set PB1 as output
    TCCR1A |= (1 << COM1A1) | (1 << WGM11); // Fast PWM, non-inverting
    TCCR1B |= (1 << WGM13) | (1 << WGM12) | (1 << CS11); // Prescaler 8
    ICR1 = 19999; // Set TOP value for 50Hz PWM (for servos)
}

void set_duty_cycle(uint16_t duty) {
    OCR1A = duty; // Set duty cycle (0 - 19999)
}

int main() {
    pwm_init();
    while (1) {
        set_duty_cycle(1500); // Example duty cycle for servo motor
    }
}
```
### Explanation:
- Uses **Fast PWM mode** on **Timer1**.
- Sets PWM frequency to **50Hz**, suitable for servo motors.
- Adjusts duty cycle using `OCR1A`.

Timers and PWM are fundamental to embedded system programming, enabling precise delays and control over external devices. Mastering these concepts will allow you to build real-time applications efficiently.
