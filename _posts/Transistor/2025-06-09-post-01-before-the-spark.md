Long before silicon chips shaped the digital age, humans were captivated by the invisible force called electricity. Ancient Greeks, around 600 BCE, rubbed amber (called *elektron* in Greek) and noticed it could attract light objects like straw and feathers. This simple curiosity hinted at a hidden power in nature—what we now call static electricity. Yet, for centuries, these effects remained curiosities without deeper understanding.

In the 18th century, experiments by **Benjamin Franklin** helped reframe electricity as a natural phenomenon. His famous kite experiment during a thunderstorm in 1752 demonstrated that lightning was electrical in nature, leading to the invention of the lightning rod, a practical and symbolic triumph of science over fear.

But it was in **1820** that electricity took a dramatic turn. **Hans Christian Ørsted**, a Danish physicist, noticed that a compass needle moved whenever he passed an electric current through a nearby wire. It was no accident—he had discovered the fundamental connection between electricity and magnetism. This breakthrough birthed the field of **electromagnetism**.

Following Ørsted, **André-Marie Ampère** swiftly developed mathematical laws describing how electric currents produce magnetic fields. His work set the stage for a unified theory of electromagnetic interactions.

Then, in the 1830s, **Michael Faraday**, often called the "Father of Electromagnetism," entered the scene. He discovered **electromagnetic induction**—a changing magnetic field induces an electric current in a conductor. This became the basis of electric generators and transformers, and underpins nearly all of modern electricity generation.

Yet Faraday made another, lesser-known discovery in **1833**. While studying silver sulfide, he found that its resistance decreased as temperature increased—a behavior unlike metals. This unusual temperature dependence hinted at a new class of materials. Though he didn't know it at the time, Faraday had glimpsed the strange behavior of what we now call **semiconductors**.

Over the decades, more pieces of the puzzle emerged. The concept of the **electron** was proposed by George Johnstone Stoney and later confirmed by **J.J. Thomson** in 1897. Still, the true nature of how electrons moved in materials—especially semiconductors—remained a mystery. Theoretical advances in quantum mechanics, such as Schrödinger’s wave functions and Fermi-Dirac statistics, would later be essential to understanding them.

By the end of the 19th century, scientists had developed crude rectifiers using crystals—**cat's whisker detectors**—but they were poorly understood and unreliable. Still, these early devices pointed toward a future where **solid-state electronics** might replace bulky, fragile vacuum tubes.

This was the quiet prologue to a seismic shift.
