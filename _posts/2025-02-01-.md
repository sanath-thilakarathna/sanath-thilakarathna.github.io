C is one of the most widely used programming languages, known for its efficiency, portability, and control over system resources. In this post, we will explore every essential feature of C, starting from basic concepts to more detailed topics. This guide aims to provide both beginners and experienced programmers with a comprehensive understanding of C.

## 1. Basic Features of C

### 1.1 Variables and Data Types

C provides fundamental data types such as:

- `int`: Integer numbers, typically 4 bytes in modern systems, capable of storing whole numbers.
- `float`: Single precision floating point numbers, commonly 4 bytes, used for decimal values.
- `double`: Double precision floating point numbers, usually 8 bytes, for higher accuracy in decimal values.
- `char`: Single character storage, generally 1 byte, used for storing a single alphabetic character or symbol.
- `void`: Represents no value, often used for functions that do not return a value.

#### Derived Data Types:
C also supports derived data types that are formed using fundamental data types:
- **Arrays**: Collection of elements of the same type.
- **Pointers**: Variables storing memory addresses.
- **Structures**: Custom-defined data types that group different variables.
- **Unions**: Similar to structures but shares memory.
- **Enumerations (enum)**: User-defined type consisting of named integer constants.

### 1.2 Operators

Operators perform various operations on variables and values.

- **Arithmetic Operators:** Perform mathematical operations.
  ```c
  int a = 10, b = 5;
  int sum = a + b;  // Addition
  int diff = a - b; // Subtraction
  int prod = a * b; // Multiplication
  int div = a / b;  // Division
  int mod = a % b;  // Modulus
  ```

- **Relational Operators:** Compare values and return boolean results.
  ```c
  if (a > b) { printf("A is greater"); }
  ```

- **Logical Operators:** Combine multiple conditions.
  ```c
  if (a > 5 && b < 10) { printf("Both conditions met"); }
  ```

- **Bitwise Operators:** Operate at the binary level.
  ```c
  int c = a & b; // Bitwise AND
  ```

### 1.3 Control Flow

Control flow statements manage the execution flow of a program:

- **Conditional Statements:**
  ```c
  if (a > b) {
      printf("A is greater");
  } else {
      printf("B is greater");
  }
  ```

- **Loops:**
  ```c
  for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
      printf("%d", i);
  }
  ```

- **Jump Statements:** `break`, `continue`, `goto`.

## 2. Functions and Modular Programming

### 2.1 Defining and Calling Functions

Functions allow structured programming by dividing the code into reusable parts.
```c
void sayHello() {
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
}
```

### 2.2 Function Parameters and Return Values
```c
int sum(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}
```

### 2.3 Recursive Functions
```c
int factorial(int n) {
    if (n == 0) return 1;
    return n * factorial(n - 1);
}
```

## 3. Pointers and Memory Management

### 3.1 Pointers
Pointers store memory addresses and allow efficient data manipulation.
```c
int x = 10;
int *ptr = &x;
printf("Value of x: %d", *ptr);
```

### 3.2 Dynamic Memory Allocation
```c
int *arr = (int*)malloc(5 * sizeof(int));
free(arr);
```

### 3.3 Pointer Arithmetic
```c
int arr[] = {10, 20, 30};
int *ptr = arr;
ptr++;
printf("Second element: %d", *ptr);
```

---

## 4. Structures and Unions

### 4.1 Structures
```c
struct Person {
    char name[50];
    int age;
};
```

### 4.2 Unions
```c
union Data {
    int i;
    float f;
};
```

## 5. File Handling in C

C provides functions for handling files such as `fopen()`, `fclose()`, `fprintf()`, `fscanf()`.

```c
FILE *file = fopen("data.txt", "w");
if (file) {
    fprintf(file, "Hello, C!");
    fclose(file);
}
```

This guide covered a wide range of C programming features, from basic syntax to essential topics like memory management, structures, and file handling. The next post will delve into **Advanced Features of C**, including **multi-threading, preprocessor directives, interfacing with assembly, and security practices**. Mastering these concepts will provide a strong foundation in system programming and software development. Happy coding!
