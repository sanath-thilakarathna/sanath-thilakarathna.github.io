Compilers play a vital role in transforming human-readable source code into executable programs. In this post, we’ll explore how a typical C compiler toolchain works by breaking it into its main stages. To make this concrete, we’ll use a simple example code snippet and follow it step-by-step from source to executable.

## Example Program

Here is a simple C program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
    printf("Hello, world!\n");
    return 0;
}
```

## Stages of Compilation

Modern C compilers, such as GCC or Clang, divide the compilation process into four primary stages:

1. Preprocessing
2. Compilation (translation to assembly)
3. Assembly
4. Linking

Let’s delve into each stage in detail.

### 1. Preprocessing
- What It Does:
    The preprocessor handles all preprocessor directives, such as #include and #define. It inserts header file contents directly into the source code, expands macros, and removes comments.
- Command Example:
```bash
gcc -E main.c -o main.i
```
This generates a preprocessed output file named `main.i`.

- Key Outcome:
    The `main.c` file is transformed into “pure” C code with all preprocessor directives replaced or removed.

### 2. Compilation (to Assembly)
- What It Does:
    Translates the preprocessed code into assembly language—a human-readable representation of machine instructions.
- Command Example:
```bash
gcc -E main.c -o main.i
```
This generates a preprocessed output file named `main.i`.

- Key Outcome:The `main.c` file is transformed into “pure” C code with all preprocessor directives replaced or removed.

### 3. Assembly

- What It Does:Converts the assembly code into object code, a binary format understood by the machine. This object file contains the program’s machine instructions along with metadata.

- Command Example:
```bash
gcc -c main.s -o main.o
```

This creates an object file named main.o.

- Key Outcome:A .o (or .obj) file containing relocatable machine code.

### 4. Linking

- What It Does:Combines one or more object files with libraries to produce the final executable. During this step, external references (e.g., `printf`) are resolved by linking the program to the standard library.

- Command Example:
```bash
gcc main.o -o myprogram
```

This produces an executable file named myprogram. Running ./myprogram prints:

```bash
Hello, world!
```

- Key Outcome:A fully linked and runnable executable file.

### End-to-End Compilation

Most users simply run:

```bash
gcc main.c -o myprogram
```

This single command handles all four stages internally: preprocessing, compilation, assembly, and linking. Intermediate files (e.g., `main.i`, `main.s`, `main.o`) are generated and discarded automatically unless specific flags are used.


### Static vs. Dynamic Linking

During the linking stage, the linker can resolve external references in two ways:

- Static Linking:Copies necessary library code directly into the executable, making it self-contained but larger in size.

- Dynamic Linking:Keeps the executable smaller by referring to shared libraries (e.g., libc.so or msvcrt.dll). These libraries must be present on the system at runtime.
