Newtonian mechanics had successfully described motion and gravity, Maxwell’s equations had unified electricity and magnetism, and thermodynamics had solidified our understanding of energy conservation and entropy. Scientists believed they had uncovered the fundamental laws of nature, with only minor discrepancies remaining to be resolved. Many physicists of the time assumed that these unresolved issues would soon be explained within the classical framework.</p> <p>This post explores the world of classical physics, the confidence it instilled in scientists, and the unresolved problems that signaled the need for a revolutionary new theory—quantum mechanics.</p> <hr> <h2 id="the-pillars-of-classical-physics"><strong>The Pillars of Classical Physics</strong></h2> <p>Classical physics was built on three major foundations:</p> <h3 id="1-newtonian-mechanics-the-laws-of-motion-and-gravitation">1. <strong>Newtonian Mechanics: The Laws of Motion and Gravitation</strong> </h3> <p>In 1687, Sir Isaac Newton published <em>Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica</em>, laying the groundwork for mechanics. His three laws of motion became fundamental principles that could explain the movement of objects, from falling apples to planetary orbits.</p> <ul> <li> <strong>First Law (Inertia):</strong> An object remains at rest or in uniform motion in a straight line unless acted upon by an external force. This principle was in direct contrast to Aristotelian physics, which required continuous force to maintain motion.</li> <li> <strong>Second Law (Force and Acceleration):</strong> The force acting on an object is equal to the mass of the object multiplied by its acceleration (F = ma). This law provided a quantitative method to describe motion.</li> <li> <strong>Third Law (Action and Reaction):</strong> For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction, explaining interactions between objects.</li> </ul> <p>Newton’s law of universal gravitation further expanded this framework by showing that every mass exerts an attractive force on every other mass. His inverse-square law of gravitation was remarkably successful in predicting planetary motion, accurately describing the orbits of celestial bodies.</p> <h3 id="2-maxwells-equations-the-unification-of-electricity-and-magnetism">2. <strong>Maxwell’s Equations: The Unification of Electricity and Magnetism</strong> </h3> <p>James Clerk Maxwell formulated a set of equations in the 1860s that described the behavior of electric and magnetic fields. These equations revealed that electric and magnetic fields are not separate phenomena but are intricately linked:</p> <ul> <li>A changing electric field creates a magnetic field, and vice versa.</li> <li>Electromagnetic waves, such as visible light, radio waves, and X-rays, propagate through space at a constant speed—the speed of light (~299,792,458 m/s).</li> </ul> <p>Maxwell’s equations provided the first theoretical prediction of electromagnetic waves, later confirmed experimentally by Heinrich Hertz in 1887. This led to the realization that light itself is an electromagnetic wave, unifying optics with electromagnetism.</p> <h3 id="3-thermodynamics-the-science-of-heat-and-energy">3. <strong>Thermodynamics: The Science of Heat and Energy</strong> </h3> <p>Thermodynamics emerged from studies of heat and work in the 19th century. The laws of thermodynamics provided a framework for understanding energy transfer:</p> <ul> <li> <strong>First Law (Conservation of Energy):</strong> Energy cannot be created or destroyed; it can only change forms. This law connected mechanics and heat, showing that heat is a form of energy.</li> <li> <strong>Second Law (Entropy and Irreversibility):</strong> The total entropy of an isolated system always increases over time. This principle explains why certain processes, such as heat flowing from a hot object to a cold one, are irreversible.</li> <li> <strong>Third Law (Absolute Zero and Order):</strong> As the temperature of a system approaches absolute zero, its entropy approaches a constant minimum, providing a limit to how cold a system can get.</li> </ul> <p>These laws explained everything from steam engines to the structure of the universe, further cementing classical physics as a complete description of nature.</p> <hr> <h2 id="the-confidence-in-classical-physics"><strong>The Confidence in Classical Physics</strong></h2> <p>By the end of the 19th century, physics seemed to be approaching perfection. Scientists like Lord Kelvin famously declared that physics was nearly complete, with only a few small discrepancies left to be resolved. Pierre-Simon Laplace even suggested that if an intelligence (now known as <em>Laplace’s Demon</em>) knew the position and velocity of every particle in the universe, it could predict the future with absolute certainty.</p> <p>Physicists viewed the remaining anomalies as minor inconsistencies that would soon be explained. However, these “minor” problems would soon unravel the entire classical framework and lead to the most profound scientific revolution of the 20th century.</p> <hr> <h2 id="cracks-begin-to-appear"><strong>Cracks Begin to Appear</strong></h2> <p>Despite the overwhelming success of classical physics, several unresolved issues hinted that something deeper was at play. These problems were not just minor inconsistencies but fundamental contradictions that classical physics could not explain:</p> <h3 id="1-the-ultraviolet-catastrophe--the-blackbody-radiation-paradox"> <strong>1. The Ultraviolet Catastrophe</strong> – The Blackbody Radiation Paradox</h3> <p>Physicists studying the radiation emitted by heated objects, known as blackbody radiation, encountered a major issue. Classical physics, using the Rayleigh-Jeans law, predicted that the energy emitted at shorter wavelengths (higher frequencies) should increase indefinitely, leading to an “ultraviolet catastrophe”—an infinite energy output at small wavelengths. This clearly did not match experimental results, where the radiation actually peaked at a certain frequency and then dropped.</p> <ul> <li> <strong>Why classical physics failed:</strong> Classical mechanics and Maxwell’s equations assumed that electromagnetic waves could take on any energy level, which led to this incorrect prediction.</li> <li> <strong>Experimental observations:</strong> Experimental results showed that energy emission followed a distinct curve, which could not be explained by existing models.</li> <li> <strong>Impact:</strong> This problem led to Max Planck’s revolutionary idea of quantizing energy, laying the foundation for quantum mechanics.</li> </ul> <h3 id="2-the-photoelectric-effect--lights-particle-nature"> <strong>2. The Photoelectric Effect</strong> – Light’s Particle Nature</h3> <p>The photoelectric effect, discovered by Heinrich Hertz in 1887 and later explained by Albert Einstein in 1905, revealed another fundamental flaw in classical wave theory.</p> <ul> <li> <strong>What was observed?</strong> When light shone on a metal surface, it ejected electrons. However, the energy of these electrons depended only on the frequency of the light, not its intensity. Classical wave theory predicted that increasing intensity should increase energy transfer, but experiments showed that if the frequency was too low, no electrons were ejected, regardless of intensity.</li> <li> <strong>Why classical physics failed:</strong> The wave model of light could not explain why energy transfer seemed quantized and dependent solely on frequency.</li> <li> <strong>Impact:</strong> Einstein proposed that light is composed of discrete packets (photons), a fundamental concept in quantum mechanics.</li> </ul> <h3 id="3-atomic-stability-problem--the-collapse-of-atoms"> <strong>3. Atomic Stability Problem</strong> – The Collapse of Atoms</h3> <p>According to classical electrodynamics, an accelerating charged particle should continuously radiate energy. Since electrons orbiting a nucleus are constantly accelerating due to centripetal force, they should continuously lose energy and spiral into the nucleus within a fraction of a second. This meant that atoms, as we know them, should not exist!</p> <ul> <li> <strong>Why classical physics failed:</strong> Maxwell’s equations predicted that electrons should emit radiation and lose energy, yet atoms remained stable.</li> <li> <strong>Experimental observations:</strong> Atoms were observed to exist in stable forms with well-defined structures, suggesting an unknown force at play.</li> <li> <strong>Impact:</strong> This problem was eventually resolved by Niels Bohr’s quantum model of the atom in 1913, which introduced quantized energy levels for electrons.</li> </ul> <h3 id="4-spectral-lines-and-atomic-structure--the-mystery-of-discrete-spectra"> <strong>4. Spectral Lines and Atomic Structure</strong> – The Mystery of Discrete Spectra</h3> <p>When gases were heated, they emitted light at specific frequencies rather than a continuous spectrum. This contradicted classical physics, which expected all wavelengths to be possible.</p> <ul> <li> <strong>Observed phenomenon:</strong> The emission and absorption spectra of elements showed distinct lines instead of a smooth gradient.</li> <li> <strong>Why classical physics failed:</strong> Classical theories suggested that electrons could have any energy level, whereas experiments showed specific, discrete energy transitions.</li> <li> <strong>Impact:</strong> This mystery was later solved by quantum mechanics, particularly through the Bohr model and the concept of quantized electron orbits.</li> </ul> <h3 id="5-the-michelson-morley-experiment-1887--the-death-of-the-aether-theory"> <strong>5. The Michelson-Morley Experiment (1887)</strong> – The Death of the Aether Theory</h3> <p>Physicists believed that light waves required a medium to propagate, much like sound requires air. This hypothetical medium was called the “luminiferous aether.” The Michelson-Morley experiment attempted to detect Earth’s motion through this aether by measuring differences in the speed of light in different directions.</p> <ul> <li> <strong>Observed phenomenon:</strong> The speed of light remained constant regardless of direction, contradicting the expected variations due to Earth’s motion.</li> <li> <strong>Why classical physics failed:</strong> Newtonian mechanics predicted that light should behave like other waves, requiring a medium and experiencing variable speeds.</li> <li> <strong>Impact:</strong> This experiment paved the way for Einstein’s theory of special relativity, which discarded the need for an aether and established the constancy of the speed of light.</li> </ul> <hr> <p>In the next post, we will explore the <strong>ultraviolet catastrophe</strong> and how Max Planck’s groundbreaking idea of quantized energy set the stage for the quantum era.</p> <p><strong>Next Post: “The Crisis of Blackbody Radiation: A Problem for Classical Physics.”</strong></p> </div> </article> <br> <hr> <br> <ul class="list-disc pl-8"></ul> <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-12">Enjoy Reading This Article?</h2> <p class="mb-2">Here are some more articles you might like to read next:</p> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="https://blog.google/technology/ai/google-gemini-update-flash-ai-assistant-io-2024/" target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener">Google Gemini updates: Flash 1.5, Gemma 2 and Project Astra</a> <svg width="1rem" height="1rem" viewbox="0 0 30 30" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"> <path d="M17 13.5v6H5v-12h6m3-3h6v6m0-6-9 9" class="icon_svg-stroke" stroke="#999" stroke-width="1.5" fill="none" fill-rule="evenodd" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"></path> </svg> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="https://medium.com/@al-folio/displaying-external-posts-on-your-al-folio-blog-b60a1d241a0a?source=rss-17feae71c3c4------2" target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener">Displaying External Posts on Your al-folio Blog</a> <svg width="1rem" height="1rem" viewbox="0 0 30 30" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"> <path d="M17 13.5v6H5v-12h6m3-3h6v6m0-6-9 9" class="icon_svg-stroke" stroke="#999" stroke-width="1.5" fill="none" fill-rule="evenodd" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"></path> </svg> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/blog/2025/fourier-transform/">Fourier Transforms - Seeing Sounds</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/blog/2025/math-in-ancient-greece/">Mathematics in Ancient Greece #4</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/blog/2025/math-in-ancient-egypy/">Mathematics in Ancient Egypt #3</a> </li> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom" role="contentinfo"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2025 Sanath Thilakarathna.
